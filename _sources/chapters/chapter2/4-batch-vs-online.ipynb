    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Explanation of Batch Learning\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Batch learning involves training a model using the entire dataset at once. The model processes all data in a batch and updates its parameters only after seeing the entire dataset.\n",
    "   - **Pros**: Suitable for stable datasets, can converge to a global optimum, and efficient when training time is not a constraint.\n",
    "   - **Cons**: Requires a large amount of memory, less adaptable to new data, and is not ideal for continuously changing environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Explanation of Online Learning\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Online learning processes data one sample or in small batches at a time, updating the model with each new data point. Itâ€™s suitable for scenarios where data arrives continuously.\n",
    "   - **Pros**: More adaptable to new data, requires less memory, and is ideal for real-time applications.\n",
    "   - **Cons**: Risk of overfitting to recent data, may take longer to converge, and requires careful tuning of learning rates\n",
